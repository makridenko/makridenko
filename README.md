### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexey Makridenko, and I've been working as a Python backend developer since 2015. I have a passion for programming and constantly strive to enhance my skills and learn new technologies.

My primary framework of expertise is Django, and I thoroughly enjoy working with it. Currently, I am immersed in the fintech sector and I am deeply interested in advancing my career in this domain.
